## Log

### [2026-06-02] Expo docs version mismatch
**What happened:** Code was written using outdated Expo APIs not present in the project's actual Expo SDK version (v56).
**Root cause:** Assumed knowledge of Expo APIs without consulting versioned docs.
**Fix applied:** Added instruction in AGENTS.md to always read https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v56.0.0/ before writing Expo code.
**Rule going forward:** Always fetch versioned Expo docs before writing any Expo/React Native code. Never rely on training-data knowledge of Expo — the API surface changes with every SDK release.

### [2026-06-02] Missing web dependencies for Expo web
**What happened:** Web build failed because required web-specific packages were absent.
**Root cause:** Expo web requires additional packages beyond the core Expo install; these were not added when web support was first needed.
**Fix applied:** Added missing web dependencies explicitly.
**Rule going forward:** When adding Expo web support, always check that `react-dom`, `@expo/webpack-config`, or Metro web config deps are present before running the web build.

### [2026-06-02] typedRoutes incompatibility with expo-router on web
**What happened:** Web build failed with a module resolution error tied to `typedRoutes` being enabled in `app.json`.
**Root cause:** `typedRoutes` (experimental) was enabled but caused the expo-router module to fail to resolve on web.
**Fix applied:** Disabled `typedRoutes` in the expo-router plugin config.
**Rule going forward:** Keep `typedRoutes` disabled unless explicitly testing typed routes on a branch where web builds are not required.
